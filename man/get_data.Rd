\section{Notes}{

20240412: There needs to be a very strict setup in REDCap. AE and violation need
to be repeating instrument. dsmc tool needs to only be in one time point. I need to
check the metadata that the project is setup correctly. Need to build later. JC
20240412: Also need to build checks for the unique identifier. JC
